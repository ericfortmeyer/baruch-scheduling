/**
 * Create an array of Hour objects
 *
 * Each hour can be flagged as booked.  An array of objects that represents "events", "appointments",
 * etc. should have a method that takes an ISO 8601 date time string as an argument to determine
 * if the "event" is on the date and time represented by the date time string.  The array of objects
 * should also be provided as an argument to this function.  Since this function and the Hour
 * objects that it creates are not concerned with what "events" are provided, the library is
 * kept free from complicated logic coordinating events with date time abstractions.  A trade-off
 * for this simplified approach is that if only a portion of all "events" are provided, there is
 * a risk that this part of the application will not receive the information necessary to ensure
 * that all "Hours" that should be flagged as booked will be.
 *
 * 1. The first hour is the start of the range of hours
 * 2. The last hour is the end of the range of hours.
 *    For example, it can be the hour the business is closed minus one
 * 3. An ISO 8601 date without the time is concatenated with each hour.  The resulting string
 *    is used as a parameter in the constructor of a DateTimeImmutable object.
 *    An ISO date time string is then produced to filter events to determine which hours
 *    in the range need to be flagged as booked.
 * 4. An array of objects that have a method that takes an ISO 8601 date time string as an
 *    argument to determine if the event that the object represents is on the date and time
 *    represented by the date time string.
 *
 * @param int $first_hour
 * @param int $last_hour
 * @param string $date yyyy-mm-dd
 * @param array<Comparable> $events
